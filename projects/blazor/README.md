# Blazor (1)

You will find samples for Blazor, a .NET application framework for Web Assembly here. To run the sample, simply type `dotnet run` at the folder of each project.

  * [Hello World](https://github.com/dodyg/practical-aspnetcore/tree/master/projects/blazor/hello-world)

    This sample is a simple modification on the project generated by `dotnet new blazor --force` command. The project template does not work all the time so here you can just try it and it will work.
